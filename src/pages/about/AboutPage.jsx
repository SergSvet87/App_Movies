          Our team used the YTS.MX resource to create this application â€” the
          only new official domain for YIFY movies. This resource provided
          excellent methods for full-fledged and high-quality display of triple
          content, and as well as the vivid interaction of our application with
          the API of the service. To go to click on the

          This is a lightweight web service, (REST interface), which provides an
          easy way to access the YTS website. An API (Application programming
          interface) is a protocol intended to be used as an interface by
          software components to communicate with each other. Our API supports
          many methods, so there should not be a problem coding some nice
          applications.
